State variables are permanently stored in contract storage. This means they're written to the Ethereum blockchain.


Unsigned Integers: uint
The uint data type is an unsigned integer, meaning its value must be non-negative. There's also an int data type for signed integers.

Note: In Solidity, uint is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsigned integer. You can declare uints with less bits â€” uint8, uint16, uint32, etc.. But in general you want to simply use uint except in specific cases, which we'll talk about in later lessons.

Solidity also supports an exponential operator (i.e. "x to the power of y", x^y);

struct ->---------------

Sometimes you need a more complex data type. For this, Solidity provides structs:

struct Person {
  uint age;
  string name;
}
// create a New Person:
Person satoshi = Person(172, "Satoshi");

// Add that person to the Array:
people.push(satoshi);

//same
people.push(Person(16, "Vitalik"));

Structs allow you to create more complicated data types that have multiple properties.
Note that we just introduced a new type, string. Strings are used for arbitrary-length UTF-8 data. Ex. string greeting = "Hello world!"

-----------------------

Arrays in Solidity

There are two types of arrays in Solidity: fixed arrays and dynamic arrays.

// Array with a fixed length of 2 elements:
uint[2] fixedArray;
// another fixed Array, can contain 5 strings:
string[5] stringArray;
// a dynamic Array - has no fixed size, can keep growing:
uint[] dynamicArray;


we can also create array of structs here(It can we used as a data base for your contract.)

Person[] people; // dynamic Array, we can keep adding to it.

here Person is struct data type..

we can define array as a public so other contract can get the value but can't write to it.

syntax->
Person[] public people;

----------------------------

functions Declarations

function eatHamburgers(string memory _name, uint _amount) public {

}
In Solidity, functions are public by default. This means anyone (or any other contract) can call your contract's function and execute its code.

We're also providing instructions about where the _name variable should be stored- in memory. This is required for all reference types such as arrays, structs, mappings, and strings.

What is a reference type you ask?

Well, there are two ways in which you can pass an argument to a Solidity function:

By value, which means that the Solidity compiler creates a new copy of the parameter's value and passes it to your function. This allows your function to modify the value without worrying that the value of the initial parameter gets changed.

By reference, which means that your function is called with a... reference to the original variable. Thus, if your function changes the value of the variable it receives, the value of the original variable gets changed.

Keccak256 and Typecasting

Ethereum has the hash function keccak256 built in, which is a version of SHA3. A hash function basically maps an input into a random 256-bit hexadecimal number. A slight change in the input will cause a large change in the hash.

Also important, keccak256 expects a single parameter of type bytes. This means that we have to "pack" any parameters before calling keccak256.

example :
//6e91ec6b618bb462a4a6ee5aa2cb0e9cf30f7a052bb467b0ba58b8748c00d2e5
keccak256(abi.encodePacked("aaaab"));
//b1f078126895a1424524de5321b339ab00408010b7cf0e6ed451514981e58aa9
keccak256(abi.encodePacked("aaaac"));

Note: Secure random-number generation in blockchain is a very difficult problem.

-----------------

Events 

Events are a way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can be 'listening' for certain events and take action when they happen.


// declare the event
event IntegersAdded(uint x, uint y, uint result);

function add(uint _x, uint _y) public returns (uint) {
  uint result = _x + _y;
  // fire an event to let the app know the function was called:
  emit IntegersAdded(_x, _y, result);
  return result;
}

Your app front-end could then listen for the event. A JavaScript implementation would look something like:

//listing to the event.

YourContract.IntegersAdded(function(error, result) {
  // do something with result
})
------------------
Note *
array.push() returns the new length of the array.

-----------------

web3.js

Ethereum has a JavaScript library called Web3.js.

example how to intract with front end and contract..

// Here's how we would access our contract:
var abi = /* abi generated by the compiler */
var ZombieFactoryContract = web3.eth.contract(abi)
var contractAddress = /* our contract address on Ethereum after deploying */
var ZombieFactory = ZombieFactoryContract.at(contractAddress)
// `ZombieFactory` has access to our contract's public functions and events

// some sort of event listener to take the text input:
$("#ourButton").click(function(e) {
  var name = $("#nameInput").val()
  // Call our contract's `createRandomZombie` function:
  ZombieFactory.createRandomZombie(name)
})

// Listen for the `NewZombie` event, and update the UI
var event = ZombieFactory.NewZombie(function(error, result) {
  if (error) return
  generateZombie(result.zombieId, result.name, result.dna)
})

// take the Zombie dna, and update our image
function generateZombie(id, name, dna) {
  let dnaStr = String(dna)
  // pad DNA with leading zeroes if it's less than 16 characters
  while (dnaStr.length < 16)
    dnaStr = "0" + dnaStr

  let zombieDetails = {
    // first 2 digits make up the head. We have 7 possible heads, so % 7
    // to get a number 0 - 6, then add 1 to make it 1 - 7. Then we have 7
    // image files named "head1.png" through "head7.png" we load based on
    // this number:
    headChoice: dnaStr.substring(0, 2) % 7 + 1,
    // 2nd 2 digits make up the eyes, 11 variations:
    eyeChoice: dnaStr.substring(2, 4) % 11 + 1,
    // 6 variations of shirts:
    shirtChoice: dnaStr.substring(4, 6) % 6 + 1,
    // last 6 digits control color. Updated using CSS filter: hue-rotate
    // which has 360 degrees:
    skinColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(6, 8) / 100 * 360),
    eyeColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(8, 10) / 100 * 360),
    clothesColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(10, 12) / 100 * 360),
    zombieName: name,
    zombieDescription: "A Level 1 CryptoZombie",
  }
  return zombieDetails
}

*********************** XXXXXXXX Level 2 ****************************

Mapping and adresses

Addresses
The Ethereum blockchain is made up of accounts, which you can think of like bank accounts. An account has a balance of Ether (the currency used on the Ethereum blockchain), and you can send and receive Ether payments to other accounts, just like your bank account can wire transfer money to other bank accounts.

Each account has an address, which you can think of like a bank account number. It's a unique identifier that points to that account, and it looks like this:

0x0cE446255506E92DF41614C46F1d6df9Cc969183

(This address belongs to the CryptoZombies team. If you're enjoying CryptoZombies, you can send us some Ether! ðŸ˜‰ )

We'll get into the nitty gritty of addresses in a later lesson, but for now you only need to understand that an address is owned by a specific user (or a smart contract).

So we can use it as a unique ID for ownership of our zombies. When a user creates new zombies by interacting with our app, we'll set ownership of those zombies to the Ethereum address that called the function.


Mappings
 Mappings are another way of storing organized data in Solidity.

Defining a mapping looks like this:

// For a financial app, storing a uint that holds the user's account balance:
mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;

// Or could be used to store / lookup usernames based on userId
mapping (uint => string) userIdToName;

A mapping is essentially a key-value store for storing and looking up data. In the first example, the key is an address and the value is a uint, and in the second example the key is a uint and the value a string.

............

Msg.sender 

msg.sender
In Solidity, there are certain global variables that are available to all functions. One of these is msg.sender, which refers to the address of the person (or smart contract) who called the current function.

Note: In Solidity, function execution always needs to start with an external caller. A contract will just sit on the blockchain doing nothing until someone calls one of its functions. So there will always be a msg.sender.

example.

mapping (address => uint) favoriteNumber;

function setMyNumber(uint _myNumber) public {
  // Update our `favoriteNumber` mapping to store `_myNumber` under `msg.sender`
  favoriteNumber[msg.sender] = _myNumber;
  // ^ The syntax for storing data in a mapping is just like with arrays
}

function whatIsMyNumber() public view returns (uint) {
  // Retrieve the value stored in the sender's address
  // Will be `0` if the sender hasn't called `setMyNumber` yet
  return favoriteNumber[msg.sender];
}

................

Import

When you have multiple files and you want to import one file into another, Solidity uses the import keyword:

import "./someothercontract.sol";

contract newContract is SomeOtherContract {

}

----------------

Storage vs Memory

In Solidity, there are two locations you can store variables â€” in storage and in memory.

Storage refers to variables stored permanently on the blockchain. Memory variables are temporary, and are erased between external function calls to your contract. Think of it like your computer's hard disk vs RAM.

Most of the time you don't need to use these keywords because Solidity handles them by default. State variables (variables declared outside of functions) are by default storage and written permanently to the blockchain, while variables declared inside functions are memory and will disappear when the function call ends.

However, there are times when you do need to use these keywords, namely when dealing with structs and arrays within functions:

Example :-

contract SandwichFactory {
  struct Sandwich {
    string name;
    string status;
  }

  Sandwich[] sandwiches;

  function eatSandwich(uint _index) public {
    // Sandwich mySandwich = sandwiches[_index];

    // ^ Seems pretty straightforward, but solidity will give you a warning
    // telling you that you should explicitly declare `storage` or `memory` here.

    // So instead, you should declare with the `storage` keyword, like:
    Sandwich storage mySandwich = sandwiches[_index];
    // ...in which case `mySandwich` is a pointer to `sandwiches[_index]`
    // in storage, and...
    mySandwich.status = "Eaten!";
    // ...this will permanently change `sandwiches[_index]` on the blockchain.

    // If you just want a copy, you can use `memory`:
    Sandwich memory anotherSandwich = sandwiches[_index + 1];
    // ...in which case `anotherSandwich` will simply be a copy of the
    // data in memory, and...
    anotherSandwich.status = "Eaten!";
    // ...will just modify the temporary variable and have no effect
    // on `sandwiches[_index + 1]`. But you can do this:
    sandwiches[_index + 1] = anotherSandwich;
    // ...if you want to copy the changes back into blockchain storage.
  }
}

--------------------

More on function visibility

The issue is we tried calling the _createZombie function from within ZombieFeeding, but _createZombie is a private function inside ZombieFactory. This means none of the contracts that inherit from ZombieFactory can access it.

private function calling from diffrnt contract which inherit that contract. would'nt be able to call that function.


Internal and External 

In addition to public and private, Solidity has two more types of visibility for functions: internal and external.

internal is the same as private, except that it's also accessible to contracts that inherit from this contract. (Hey, that sounds like what we want here!).

external is similar to public, except that these functions can ONLY be called outside the contract â€” they can't be called by other functions inside that contract. We'll talk about why you might want to use external vs public later.

----------------------

in Solidity you can return more than one value from a function.

-----------------------

Let's look at an example of interacting with our deployed contract using JavaScript and web3.js:

var abi = /* abi generated by the compiler */
var ZombieFeedingContract = web3.eth.contract(abi)
var contractAddress = /* our contract address on Ethereum after deploying */
var ZombieFeeding = ZombieFeedingContract.at(contractAddress)

// Assuming we have our zombie's ID and the kitty ID we want to attack
let zombieId = 1;
let kittyId = 1;

// To get the CryptoKitty's image, we need to query their web API. This
// information isn't stored on the blockchain, just their webserver.
// If everything was stored on a blockchain, we wouldn't have to worry
// about the server going down, them changing their API, or the company
// blocking us from loading their assets if they don't like our zombie game ;)
let apiUrl = "https://api.cryptokitties.co/kitties/" + kittyId
$.get(apiUrl, function(data) {
  let imgUrl = data.image_url
  // do something to display the image
})

// When the user clicks on a kitty:
$(".kittyImage").click(function(e) {
  // Call our contract's `feedOnKitty` method
  ZombieFeeding.feedOnKitty(zombieId, kittyId)
})

// Listen for a NewZombie event from our contract so we can display it:
ZombieFactory.NewZombie(function(error, result) {
  if (error) return
  // This function will display the zombie, like in lesson 1:
  generateZombie(result.zombieId, result.name, result.dna)
})
