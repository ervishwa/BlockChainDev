Important Points ->

Note: Giving the owner special powers over the contract like this is often necessary, but it could also be used maliciously. For example, the owner could add a backdoor function that would allow him to transfer anyone's zombies to himself!

So it's important to remember that just because a DApp is on Ethereum does not automatically mean it's decentralized â€” you have to actually read the full source code to make sure it's free of special controls by the owner that you need to potentially worry about. There's a careful balance as a developer between maintaining control over a DApp such that you can fix potential bugs, and building an owner-less platform that your users can trust to secure their data.


Note: calldata is somehow similar to memory, but it's only available to external functions.
